Code for ISBI'19 Tutorial 

This repository contains code and slides that are dedicated to reproduce part of the examples presented at ISBI'19 in Venice during the tutorial entitled: "Recent advances in acquisition and reconstruction for Compressed Sensing MRI". The code focuses on basics and recent advances in MR acquisition or design of k-space sampling schemes.  
All aspects related to MRI reconstruction in this tutorial will be teached by [Prof. Jeff Fessler](https://github.com/JeffFessler/MIRT.jl) with code and examples in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) language.

Here, The repository gathers original Matlab code developed by my former PhD students, Nicolas Chauffert and Carole Lazarus and located in the matlab folder.
As we're moving to Python langauge, I and my student Nicolas Chartier started to recode the basics form MRI sampling. Note that image reconstruction we rely on our own python package, namely PySAP : https://github.com/CEA-COSMIC/pysap and its dedicated plugin for MR image reconstruction: https://github.com/CEA-COSMIC/pysap-mri.
