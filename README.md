Code for ISBI'19 Tutorial 

This repository contains code that is dedicated to reproduce part of the examples presented at ISBI'19 in Venice during
the tutorial entitled: "Recent advances in acquisition and reconstruction for Compressed Sensing MRI". The code focuses on recent advanes in MR acquisition or design of k-space sampling schemes.  

It gathers original Matlab code developed by my former PhD students, Nicolas Chauffert and Carole Lazarus in the matlab folder.
Progressively, we are moving this code to Python language in the python folder. For image reconstruction we rely on our own python package, namely PySAP : https://github.com/CEA-COSMIC/pysap and its dedicated plugin for MR image reconstruction: https://github.com/CEA-COSMIC/pysap-mri.
